# ðŸ“œ Beyond the Basics: How to Use LanguageExt and Specification Pattern for Validation in .NET ðŸ“¦

In this article, we'll explore an approach to validation in .NET using the LanguageExt library and the **Specification Pattern** to improve code readability and maintainability. In the .NET world, validation is done in various ways, but many common practices have limitations that impact code scalability and performance. Here, we'll analyze these practices and build a cleaner, more functional solution.

## Issues with Common Validation Approaches

Often, we see validation code structured as follows:

1. **Simple Boolean Return Approach**: Frequently, validation methods return only `true` or `false`, indicating whether the object is valid. This, however, limits control over specific errors and makes detailed handling of validation responses difficult.
   
2. **Error List Approach (IEnumerable of Strings)**: Another common practice is to accumulate errors in a list of strings, returning this list at the end of validation. This improves error visibility but can be confusing, as the consumer of the code must interpret an empty list as successful validation. Moreover, this approach lacks clarity regarding the type and nature of the errors.

Both approaches suffer from scalability and complexity issues, especially in scenarios where specific validations need to be applied dynamically.

## A Functional Solution with LanguageExt and the Specification Pattern

The **LanguageExt** library offers a powerful set of functional tools in .NET. Using **monads**, such as `Either` and `Validation`, we can structure validations in a clearer and more modular way. By combining the Specification Pattern, which allows for reusable rule creation, we achieve a clean and extensible solution.

### 1. Structuring Validations with the Specification Pattern

The **Specification Pattern** is ideal for situations where validation rules vary and can be combined. We define an `ISpecification` interface with an `IsSatisfiedBy` method, which takes an object and returns `true` or `false`, and an `ErrorMessage` that holds the error message:

```csharp
public interface ISpecification<T>
{
    bool IsSatisfiedBy(T entity);
    string ErrorMessage { get; }
}
```

Next, we can implement specifications like `EmailSpecification` and `AgeSpecification`:

```csharp
public class EmailSpecification : ISpecification<User>
{
    public bool IsSatisfiedBy(User user) =>
        !string.IsNullOrEmpty(user.Email) && user.Email.Contains("@");

    public string ErrorMessage => "Invalid email.";
}

public class AgeSpecification : ISpecification<User>
{
    public bool IsSatisfiedBy(User user) =>
        user.Age >= 18 && user.Age <= 120;

    public string ErrorMessage => "Age must be between 18 and 120.";
}
```

#### 2. Combining Specifications and Using LanguageExt for Error Handling

With the specifications in place, we create a validation method using `Validation<Error, T>`, where `Error` represents the collection of accumulated errors and `T` is the type being validated. In LanguageExt, the `Validation` type allows multiple validations to fail simultaneously, accumulating errors.

First, we define the `ValidationError` type to encapsulate error messages:

```csharp
public record ValidationError(string Message);
```

Then, we create a method that runs each specification and accumulates errors using `Validation<ValidationError, User>`:

```csharp
public static Validation<ValidationError, User> ValidateUser(User user)
{
    var specifications = new List<ISpecification<User>>
    {
        new EmailSpecification(),
        new AgeSpecification()
    };

    var errors = specifications
        .Where(spec => !spec.IsSatisfiedBy(user))
        .Select(spec => new ValidationError(spec.ErrorMessage))
        .ToSeq();

    return errors.Any() ? Validation<ValidationError, User>.Fail(errors) : Validation<ValidationError, User>.Success(user);
}
```

In this example, if any errors are found, the validation returns a list of `ValidationError`. Otherwise, it returns the `User` object, indicating it passed the checks.

#### 3. Integrating with API Responses

For an API scenario, using `Validation` allows automatic mapping of the result to a .NET `IResult`, making it easy to return an appropriate response:

```csharp
public static IResult ValidateAndRespond(User user)
{
    var validationResult = ValidateUser(user);

    return validationResult.Match(
        success => Results.Ok(success),
        errors => Results.BadRequest(errors.Select(e => e.Message))
    );
}
```

Here, the `Match` function checks if validation was successful or not. On success, we return `200 OK` with the `User` object; otherwise, we return `400 Bad Request` with the error messages.

### 4. Benefits of the Functional Approach with LanguageExt

- **Clarity and Readability**: The functional code structure and use of `Validation` make the validation flow intuitive, without the need for mutable lists.
- **Scalability**: The Specification Pattern allows easy addition and combination of validation rules.
- **Performance**: The code avoids unnecessary validations through short-circuiting and doesn't need to allocate additional lists.
- **Ease of Integration**: The `Validation` result can be easily mapped to HTTP responses in APIs.

## Conclusion

Combining LanguageExt with the Specification Pattern provides a modular and functional validation approach, making error handling easier and improving scalability. Besides organizing the code, this method allows robust and adaptable control over validation rule execution, favoring the development of more secure and maintainable .NET applications.

This technique can be extended to various scenarios where complex validations and multiple conditions need to be managed. For developers who want to explore the potential of LanguageExt and functional techniques in C#, this is an excellent solution to get started.
