# ✉️ Transactional Outbox Pattern: Ensure Data Consistency with Asynchronous Messaging in .NET 📬

In this article, we’ll explore the **Transactional Outbox Pattern**, an essential pattern for ensuring data consistency in systems that use messaging. This pattern is widely used in scenarios where you need to ensure that a change in the database is safely replicated to other systems, such as message queues. In this example, we’ll use **Amazon SQS** and the **MassTransit** library to implement the Outbox Pattern. Note that this pattern is messaging-service agnostic and can be used with RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, and others.

### The Problem

Imagine you have a customer API. When creating a new customer, you may need to send a confirmation email or trigger other functionalities. A naive implementation would add these calls directly to the code that creates the customer. This can make the code slow and complex, especially in scalable or distributed systems, as creating a customer and triggering dependent processes simultaneously can compromise application performance and robustness.

An efficient solution is to use a message queue to process these actions asynchronously. This way, you can add the customer to the database and return a response immediately, while other actions occur in the background.

### The Consistency Challenge

While using message queues solves the complexity problem, it introduces a new challenge: **ensuring both the customer and the message are persisted consistently**. The main issue is that most databases and messaging systems do not support distributed transactions or two-phase commits, making it difficult to guarantee consistency between operations.

### Solution: Transactional Outbox Pattern

The Transactional Outbox Pattern solves the consistency problem by breaking the operation into two steps:

1. **Create the customer and register the creation event** in an outbox table in the database, in a single transaction.
2. A secondary service reads the outbox table and publishes the events to the message queue.

This way, we have an **atomic transaction** between creating the customer and inserting the event into the outbox table, ensuring that any failure in sending to the queue is handled by the outbox service itself.

### Implementing the Outbox Pattern with MassTransit and Amazon SQS

#### Initial Setup

First, add **MassTransit** to the project. MassTransit is a library that abstracts the use of different queues and message publishing/subscription mechanisms. It allows working with RabbitMQ, SQS, Azure Service Bus, and more in an agnostic way. For SQS, MassTransit automatically creates the necessary queues.

```csharp
// MassTransit configuration in Program.cs
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.UsingAmazonSqs((context, cfg) => 
    {
        cfg.Host("us-east-1");
    });
});
```

#### Creating the Outbox Pattern

To implement the Outbox Pattern, add a new table to the database called `Outbox`. This table stores events that will be sent to the queue later.

1. Modify the `DbContext` to include the `InboxState`, `OutboxState`, and `OutboxMessage` tables, which are necessary for the Outbox Pattern to work.

```csharp
public class YourDbContext : DbContext
{
    public YourDbContext(DbContextOptions<YourDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

        modelBuilder.AddInboxStateEntity();
        modelBuilder.AddOutboxMessageEntity();
        modelBuilder.AddOutboxStateEntity();
    }
}
```

2. In the customer creation service, log the creation event in the `Outbox` table instead of sending it directly to the queue. This way, the customer creation and event logging are done in a single transaction.

```csharp
public async Task AddCustomerAsync(Customer customer)
{
    await _dbContext.Customers.AddAsync(customer);
    await _dbContext.OutboxMessages.AddAsync(new OutboxMessage { /* event data */ });
    await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
}
```

3. Configure MassTransit to read the `Outbox` table and publish events to the queue.

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddEntityFrameworkOutbox<YourDbContext>(cfg =>
    {
        cfg.UsePostgres();
        cfg.UseBusOutbox(); // Enables the Outbox Pattern in MassTransit
    });
});
```

4. Run migrations to create the new tables.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddOutbox
dotnet ef database update
```

#### Consuming Events

Finally, configure a worker to consume the messages published to the queue. This worker listens to the queue and processes events independently.

### Advantages of the Outbox Pattern

1. **Consistency**: Ensures that the customer is created and the event is published without relying on distributed transactions.
2. **Resilience**: In case of publishing failures, the event can be resent later, maintaining data consistency.
3. **Performance**: The Outbox Pattern allows dependent operations to be processed asynchronously, improving system performance.

### Final Considerations

The Transactional Outbox Pattern is a practical solution for distributed applications that need consistency between the database and the message queue. With tools like MassTransit, it is possible to implement the pattern efficiently, allowing for greater scalability and resilience in your application.
